Hi. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for trying ibus-zime.

ibus-zime consists of two different IM engines, namely `Stylo`, the wholer-sentence model, and `Plume`, the phrase-based model.
I suggest new users give Plume a try first, since it provides more functionalities, and a slightly better user experience.

Quick Start:

0. Make sure you've installed IBus:

http://ibus.googlecode.com/

1. Run `make' with super user privilege under extracted ibus-zime folder.

cd ibus-zime
sudo make install

2. Install the schema(s) of your choice.

# NOTE: Run the scripts under ibus-zime/data/ as normal user. DB files will be created for current user only.
# The resulting SQLite3 database files would be ~/.ibus/zime/plume.db, or ~/.ibus/zime/stylo.db.
# If you prefer Stylo engine, change `plume-' to `stylo-' in the commands below.

cd data

# a) Install schema: Pinyin

./plume-create-schema.py -v -s pinyin

# b) Install schema: Jyutping (Cantonese)
./make-phrases.py jyutping
./plume-create-schema.py -v -s jyutping

# c) Install schema: Kuank-hiunn (Middle Chinese)
./make-phrases.py kuankhiunn
./plume-create-schema.py -v -s kuankhiunn

# d) Install schema: Zhuyin (Bopomofo)
./plume-create-schema.py -v -s zhuyin

# e) Install schema: Combo Pinyin (Refer to ZIME project home page)
# NOTE: This schema requires Pinyin schema already installed (and with fuzzy input options off).
./plume-create-schema.py -k combo-pinyin-schema.txt

# Combo Pinyin for Stylo uses a different schema file from Plume's, due to the differences in their implementation:
./stylo-create-schema.py -k combo-pinyin-schema-for-stylo.txt

# f) Invent your own schema!

3. Restart IBus and enable ZIME engine(s) in IBus preferences.

4. When ZIME is active, you can always type Ctrl+` to call schema chooser menu, and choose among installed schemas.

Sorry for the temporary absence of documentation.
Feel free to explore.
