# README

Hi. Thank you for taking time to read this, and for trying ibus-zime.

Quick Start:

0. Make sure you've installed IBus:

http://ibus.googlecode.com/

1. Run `make install' with super user privilege under extracted ibus-zime folder.

cd ibus-zime/
sudo make install
make restart_ibus

2. Install the schema(s) of your choice.

# NOTE: Run these commands under ibus-zime/data/ as normal user. 
# The resulting SQLite3 database file will be created for current user only, at ~/.ibus/zime/zime.db.

# NOTE: If you're upgrading from a previous MAJOR version of ibus-zime (say, 2.x verus 3.x), 
# clear the incompatible DB file with the command `make clear_db'.

# Install schema: Pinyin :(simplified), DoublePinyin, ComboPinyin (ZIME special offer)
make schema_pinyin

# Install schema: TonalPinyin (recommended:)
make schema_tonal_pinyin

# Install schema: Zhuyin (Bopomofo)
make schema_zhuyin

# Install schema: Quick (a Cangjie variant)
make schema_quick

# Install schema: Jyutping (Cantonese)
make schema_jyutping

# Install schema: Wu (Shanghainese)
make schema_wu

# Invent your own schema!
# Guides and more schema samples available at

3. Restart IBus and enable ZIME engine in IBus preferences.

4. When ZIME is active, type Ctrl+` to choose from installed schemas.

Sorry for the temporary short of documentation. Feel free to explore.
