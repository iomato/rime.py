Hi. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for trying ibus-zime.

Quick Start:

0. Make sure you've installed IBus:

http://ibus.googlecode.com/

1. Run `make' with super user privilege under extracted ibus-zime folder.

cd ibus-zime
sudo make install

2. Install the schema(s) of your choice.

# NOTE: Run the scripts under ibus-zime/data/ as normal user. DB files will be created for current user only.
# The resulting SQLite3 database file would be ~/.ibus/zime/zime.db.
# delete this file if you've been using a previous major version of ibus-zime.

cd data

# a) Install schema: Pinyin
./create-schema.py -v Pinyin.txt

# b) Install schema: Combo Pinyin (Refer to ZIME project home page)
# NOTE: If you haven't got Pinyin schema already installed, remove `-k` option in the following command.
./create-schema.py -v -k ComboPinyin.txt

# c) Install schema: Tonal Pinyin
./create-schema.py -v TonalPinyin.txt

# d) Install schema: Zhuyin (Bopomofo)
./create-schema.py -v Zhuyin.txt

# e) Install schema: Jyutping (Cantonese)
./make-phrases.py jyutping
./create-schema.py -v Jyutping.txt

# f) Install schema: Kuankhiunn (Middle Chinese)
./make-phrases.py kuankhiunn
./create-schema.py -v Kuankhiunn.txt

# g) Invent your own schema!

3. Restart IBus and enable ZIME engine in IBus preferences.

4. When ZIME is active, you can always type Ctrl+` to call schema chooser menu, and choose among installed schemas.

Sorry for the temporary absence of documentation.
Feel free to explore.
