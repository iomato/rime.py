hi. 

ibus-zime consists of two ditinct IM engines, namely Stylo, the whole-sentence-based, and Plume, the phrase-based.

how to install:

0. install IBus: 
http://ibus.googlecode.com/

1. run the shell commands: 
cd ibus-zime
sudo make install

2. install the schema of your choice:
cd data
# pinyin
./stylo-create-schema.py pinyin-schema.txt pinyin-keywords.txt pinyin-phrases.txt
# bopomofo zhuyin
./stylo-create-schema.py zhuyin-schema.txt zhuyin-keywords.txt zhuyin-phrases.txt
# combo pinyin (refer to ZIME project home page)
./stylo-create-schema.py -k combo-pinyin-schema.txt
# jyutping (cantonese)
./make-phrases.py jyutping
./stylo-create-schema.py jyutping-schema.txt jyutping-keywords.txt jyutping-phrases.txt
# kuank-hiunn (middle chinese)
./make-phrases.py kuankhiunn
./stylo-create-schema.py kuankhiunn-schema.txt kuankhiunn-keywords.txt kuankhiunn-phrases.txt
# feel free to define your own schema.
# the sample text files provided are good for both engines. 
# (but currently Plume has no support for zhuyin and combo pinyin yet)
# change `stylo-' to `plume-' in the commands above to initialize the database for Plume engine.
# the resulting SQLite database is located at ~/.ibus/zime/stylo.db, or ~/.ibus/zime/plume.db.

3. restart IBus and enable ZIME engine(s) in IBus preferences.

4. when ZIME is active, you can always type Ctrl+` to call schema chooser menu.

sorry for the temporary absense of documentation.
