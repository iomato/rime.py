Hi. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for trying ibus-zime.

ibus-zime consists of two different IM engines, namely `Stylo`, the wholer-sentence model, and `Plume`, the phrase-based model.
I suggest new users give Plume a try first.

Quick Start:

0. Make sure you've installed IBus:
http://ibus.googlecode.com/

1. Run `make' with super user privilege under extracted ibus-zime folder.
cd ibus-zime
sudo make install

2. Install the schema(s) of your choice.
# NOTE: Run the scripts under ibus-zime/data/ as normal user. DB files will be created for current user only.
# The resulting SQLite3 database files would be ~/.ibus/zime/plume.db, or ~/.ibus/zime/stylo.db.
cd data

# Install schema: Pinyin
./plume-create-schema.py -v -s pinyin

# Install schema: Jyutping (Cantonese)
./make-phrases.py jyutping
./plume-create-schema.py -v -s jyutping

# Install schema: Kuank-hiunn (Middle Chinese)
./make-phrases.py kuankhiunn
./plume-create-schema.py -v -s kuankhiunn

# Change `plume-' to `stylo-' in the commands above to install the schemas for Stylo engine.
# The following two methods are implemented only in Stylo currently.

# Install schema: Zhuyin (Bopomofo)
./stylo-create-schema.py -v -s zhuyin

# Install schema: Combo Pinyin (Refer to ZIME project home page)
./stylo-create-schema.py -k -s combo-pinyin

3. Restart IBus and enable ZIME engine(s) in IBus preferences.

4. When ZIME is active, you can always type Ctrl+` to call schema chooser menu, and choose among installed schemas.

Sorry for the temporary absense of documentation.
Feel free to explore.
