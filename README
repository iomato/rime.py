hi. 
thank you for taking time to read this, and for trying ibus-zime.

ibus-zime consists of two different IM engines, namely `Stylo`, the wholer-sentence model, and `Plume`, the phrase-based model.

how to install:

0. make sure you've installed IBus: 
http://ibus.googlecode.com/

1. run the following shell commands: 
cd ibus-zime
sudo make install

2. install the schema(s) of your choice:
cd data
# Pinyin
./stylo-create-schema.py pinyin-schema.txt pinyin-keywords.txt pinyin-phrases.txt
# Zhuyin (Bopomofo)
./stylo-create-schema.py zhuyin-schema.txt zhuyin-keywords.txt zhuyin-phrases.txt
# Combo Pinyin (refer to ZIME project home page)
./stylo-create-schema.py -k combo-pinyin-schema.txt
# Jyutping (Cantonese)
./make-phrases.py jyutping
./stylo-create-schema.py jyutping-schema.txt jyutping-keywords.txt jyutping-phrases.txt
# Kuank-hiunn (Middle Chinese)
./make-phrases.py kuankhiunn
./stylo-create-schema.py kuankhiunn-schema.txt kuankhiunn-keywords.txt kuankhiunn-phrases.txt
# these sample text files provided are good for both engines. 
# (but currently Plume has no support for Zhuyin and Combo Pinyin yet)
# change `stylo-' to `plume-' in the commands above to initialize the database for Plume engine.
# the resulting SQLite3 database is located at ~/.ibus/zime/stylo.db, or ~/.ibus/zime/plume.db.

3. restart IBus and enable ZIME engine(s) in IBus preferences.

4. when ZIME is active, you can always type Ctrl+` to call schema chooser menu.

sorry for the temporary absense of documentation.
feel free to explore.
